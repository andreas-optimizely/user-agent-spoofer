On October 4th, Optimizely release the Optimizely X platform containing many powerful updates to the classic Optimizely A/B testing solution.

One of these updates includes an easy to use visual editor built for responsive design sites. While powerful for responsive designs, this can make creating mobile web experiments for adaptive websites more difficult. That's why I built this Chrome Extension.

This Chrome Extension, when enabled changes the user agent of the site loading in the Optimizely X visual editor to an iPhone 6 iOS 10.

##How to Use

1. Download the extension - extension is turned off by default
2. To enable, click the Extension Icon
3. Load your mobile website in the Optimizely X Editor
4. To disable, click the Extension icon again and reload the Optimizely X editor

##Roadmap

- Build UI for multiple user agent options
